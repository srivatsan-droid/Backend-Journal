# ☕ Java Backend Developer Journey 🚀

Hey there! I'm **Srivatsan** — fueled by ☕ & curiosity — on a mission to become a **kickass Java Backend Developer**.  

This is my **learning diary**, **project lab**, and **motivation tracker**, all brewed together like a strong filter coffee.  
I'm diving into everything backend — from Spring Boot to Microservices — one sip at a time. 💻
